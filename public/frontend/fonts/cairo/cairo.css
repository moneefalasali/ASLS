/*
 Temporarily disabled @font-face declarations because the local woff2 files
 are missing/corrupted (0 bytes). This prevents the browser attempting to
 download and decode empty font files which caused the "Failed to decode"
 warnings during development.

 To restore the Cairo webfont behavior:
 1. Download the proper Cairo .woff2 files (weights 400/600/700) into this folder
    (public/frontend/fonts/cairo/) and ensure they're non-empty.
 2. Replace this file with the original @font-face rules or remove these comments.

 For now the app will use system fallback fonts below.

/* In rare cases other rules reference 'Cairo' explicitly; ensure a fallback
